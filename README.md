# atom-python-yapf
Atom.io plugin to format Python files using Google's [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf)

### Install

Make sure you have `YAPF` installed and the correct path to binary was set in the package config.

### Keymap

Currently, there are two commands:

* `python-yapf:formatCode` - for formatting python code
* `python-yapf:checkFormat` - for checking format of python code

> Heavily influenced by Benjamin Hedrich's [atom-python-isort](https://github.com/bh/atom-python-isort), which I suggest you use in tandem with this plugin.
